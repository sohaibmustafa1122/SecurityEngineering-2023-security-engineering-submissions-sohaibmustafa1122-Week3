#Task 1: Lock-ins

Technological lock-in is a condition whereby users or organizations are heavily dependent on a certain technology, and therefore it is expensive to change to another technology. For instance, a firm implementing a software with a closed architecture could experience a lot of difficulty, and incur high costs in transferring to another platform because of the issues of compatibility, and staff training and development (Anderson, 2020). Vendor lock-in, however, is a situation in which the customer is locked into a particular vendor for products or services making it expensive and or impossible to change the provider. An example is using a cloud service provider with tools that are difficult to migrate (Shapiro & Varian, 1999).
The break-free costs outlined include they are related to the costs of undoing lock-ins including retraining of personnel, reconfiguring existing systems and data migration. These processes can be time-consuming and may cause a lot of interference with business operations. However, this is restricted in a lock-in because it detrimental to innovation, flexibility and escalating the long-term costs. However, it can also provide stable and dependable support from the vendor or technology supplier (Anderson, 2020).

###Task 2: Security Psychology

#Phishing attacks effectiveness

Phishing attacks work because they are based on psychological principles. When people feel rushed, often they make hasty decisions. Phishing emails almost always appear to originate from a trustworthy source and this makes it easier for the con-artists to engage users. Moreover, attackers set the tone to some of the messages to evoke certain feelings, such as fear or curiosity, which makes people make a decision without first considering it. This is the reason why phishing attacks are so effective – they combine trust and the sense of urgency.

#Why Social Engineering Works on People

Social engineering is effective because it exploits normal human actions. It is human nature to believe in others, especially when such other people seem to be in a higher rank or belong to the same group as the believer. This is why attackers take advantage of this trust in that when they come as the people you trust they get you to reveal sensitive information. Also, people are forced to obey the request because of the norms that discourage them from arguing or creating conflict.

##Why Many People Have a Hard Time Using Passwords Securely

The only aspect of password use that pushes many users into making secure password choices a nightmare is the relatively short memorable string. People are lazy by default, and it is inconvenient to remember different passwords for different accounts. This almost always leads to either the setting of weak passwords which are easy to remember or repeating the same password on every account. Moreover, the mental processes involved in generating and storing complex passwords safely are not considered as important as the processes of routine.

##Why PGP Fails to Be an Effective Way to Secure Email

PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) encryption fails to gain widespread use due to its complexity. The process of generating, sharing, and managing encryption keys is difficult for the average user, leading many to avoid it. Most people prefer easier, more straightforward solutions for email security. The technical nature of PGP presents a barrier that prevents it from being a practical tool for securing email communication for everyday users, even though it offers strong protection.

##Why It Is So Easy to Spread Malware

Malware spreads easily because it exploits human behavior. People tend to trust familiar sources, often clicking on links or downloading attachments without verifying their authenticity. Attackers also take advantage of people’s habits of acting quickly online, where they may not take time to think critically about the safety of their actions. Social engineering techniques, such as sending malware through seemingly trustworthy contacts or platforms, make it even easier to trick individuals into spreading malware unknowingly.


###Task 3A: Intellectual Rights

Different legal tools and means, and technologies help companies to protect their tangible and intangible assets. Below is a brief explanation of each safeguarding method along with relevant use cases:

Intellectual Property (IP): IP stands for Intellectual Property and it encompasses inventions, literary and artistic works, and symbols, designs or models. They are patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets. Tesla Company is an example with its patents of electric vehicle technology protect innovative Tesla designs from competitors (Collective Hub, 2020).

Copyright: Copyright safeguards creative works and includes such things as books, software and music among other creations. It provides the owner with legal monopoly to use and dispose the work in question. For instance, the series of book harry porter is under the copyright law hence it is prohibited for another individual or company to reproduce the books or create other related books or movies (Legal Reader, 2020).

Patent: Patents assign inventors the legal monopoly to use, commercialize or license a new invention for a certain number of years which ranges between 15-20 years at most. This is especially important in such sectors as the pharmaceutical one – the patenting of drugs to safeguard the costs behind the research (US Patent and Trademark Office, 2019). One good example of this protection in the automotive industry is Tesla’s technology patents.

Trademark: Trademark is a symbol, logo or name that safeguards brand identities to prevent customers from confusing one brand with another. For example, Nike’s "Swoosh” logo is another form of ensuring that customers remain loyal to the certain trademark they see most often (Thales, 2023).

Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs): It exists in law as a legal agreement that seek to prevent the disclosure of information in business transactions. Large corporations such as google employ the NDAs especially in their business deals with third parties in order to protect innovations and inventions as well as innovations (Seastone IP, 2024).

Watermarks: Watermarks are some sort of identifying markings placed customers oftentimes on various images, and videos intended to check for illegitimate usage. For example, websites that offer stock photos place watermarks on the photos, and only delete them after the buyer has paid (WIPO, 2020).

Software Licenses: These are contractual terms which specify how certain software can be utilized and spread. For instance, Microsoft grants licenses for its Office line in order to prevent the unauthorized use or copying of the software (Thales, 2023).

Digital Rights Management (DRM): DRM technologies regulate access to copyrighted digital media as motion pictures, music, books or games with the purpose of avoiding piracy. Netflix, for instance, employs DRM to make its contents hard to be downloaded and distributed illegitimately (WIPO, 2020).

Software Protection Dongles: Dongles are hardware devices which enable users to access licensed software. They are widely applied in such sectors as engineering, as high-level software, for instance, CAD, should be protected from piracy (Thales, 2023).

Taking into account these legal mechanisms and technologies correlate to protect innovative, brands, and other creations to warrant that companies can securely monetize their IPRs.

###Task 3B: Freedom of Information

DRM and copyright protection are beneficial to defending free content, however, there are many instances where these barriers have been circumvented, and in turn, they demonstrate that use of such barriers can be a daunting issue. A good example is the music industry and DRM on Apple’s iTunes platform. Apple incorporated DRM to deny users the ability to playback music files on more than five devices andτς the number of times a particular playlist could be burnt into a CD. While these restraints were meant to fight illegitimate distribution, they inconvenienced legitimate customers who experience the measures as oppressive, which over time, created dissatisfaction and a desire for a changed digital rights and user liberties. There was so much criticism saying that DRM in this instance was rather restrictive and due to pressure from users and changing market scenarios Apple did away with DRM for music in 2009 (Stanford University, 2024). This case raises concern that normally exists between the interests of owning Information content and consumer interest as DRM normally restricts consumers to certain usage regimes which at times infringe the fair use provisions. Opponents ranging from Lawrence Lessig, the digital rights activist, stated that DRM enabled the companies to stretch the protection of works beyond the legal term, especially where a work was supposed to be in the public domain (Stanford University, 2024). This case showed how companies can use DRM technologies to perpetuate control over content that by legal right should be open for public use.

However, piracy is one of the most common techniques that defeat DRM and current copyright laws at the moment. One great example in this regard is the piracy of adobe Photoshop software, which is to this day among the most pirated software as it is highly priced. However, there are always fakes of Adobe Photoshop, which are distributed with the help of DRM, and often contain viruses. This goes a long way in illustrating the ease at which companies continuously struggle between giving people access to their products while safeguarding their intellectual property rights from piracy while at the same time not putting their prices to a level that is manageable by users to some extent (Bytescare, 2024). These examples illustrate the practical failings of DRM and copyright protection, which, at times, go to the edge of reasonable use and consumer rights, and equally present how tenacious actors can continue to get round such systems. Opponents of overly restrictive DRM can thus threaten legitimate consumer, while piracy underlines the need for acccesible and consumer-friendly measures used to protect intellectual property without damaging consumers’ rights, or driving them to piracy.

Another example of the bypassing of copyright protections is the story of Adobe’s eBooks. Adobe applied high levels of DRM on its electronic version of Alice in Wonderland even though the book is in the public domain. Adobe achieved this through DRM whereby users could not share the eBook around or turn on the “Read Aloud” feature which the latter allowed. Opponents ranging from Lawrence Lessig, the digital rights activist, stated that DRM enabled the companies to stretch the protection of works beyond the legal term, especially where a work was supposed to be in the public domain (Stanford University, 2024). This case showed how companies can use DRM technologies to perpetuate control over content that by legal right should be open for public use.
