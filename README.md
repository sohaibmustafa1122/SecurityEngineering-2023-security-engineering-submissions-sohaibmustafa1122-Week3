###Task 1: Lock-ins

Technological lock-in is a condition whereby users or organizations are heavily dependent on a certain technology, and therefore it is expensive to change to another technology. For instance, a firm implementing a software with a closed architecture could experience a lot of difficulty, and incur high costs in transferring to another platform because of the issues of compatibility, and staff training and development (Anderson, 2020). Vendor lock-in, however, is a situation in which the customer is locked into a particular vendor for products or services making it expensive and or impossible to change the provider. An example is using a cloud service provider with tools that are difficult to migrate (Shapiro & Varian, 1999).
The break-free costs outlined include they are related to the costs of undoing lock-ins including retraining of personnel, reconfiguring existing systems and data migration. These processes can be time-consuming and may cause a lot of interference with business operations. However, this is restricted in a lock-in because it detrimental to innovation, flexibility and escalating the long-term costs. However, it can also provide stable and dependable support from the vendor or technology supplier (Anderson, 2020).

###Task 2: Security Psychology
##Phishing Attacks Effectiveness

Phishing attacks are effective because they play on human psychology. People often make quick decisions, especially when feeling urgency or pressure. Phishing emails tend to look like they come from trusted sources, creating a false sense of security. Additionally, attackers design these emails to trigger emotional responses, like fear or curiosity, which pushes people to act quickly without thinking critically. This combination of trust and urgency is what makes phishing attacks so successful.

Why Social Engineering Works on People

Social engineering works because it manipulates common human behaviors. People are naturally inclined to trust others, especially when those others appear to be in positions of authority or part of a social group they belong to. Attackers exploit this trust by posing as legitimate figures or using friendly approaches to get people to share sensitive information. Additionally, social norms often lead people to comply with requests to avoid confrontation or conflict, making them vulnerable to manipulation.

Why Many People Have a Hard Time Using Passwords Securely

Many people struggle with secure password practices due to the challenge of remembering complex and unique passwords. Humans are wired to prioritize convenience, and remembering different passwords for multiple accounts feels overwhelming. This often results in the use of simple, easy-to-remember passwords or reusing the same one across platforms. Additionally, the cognitive effort required to create and store strong passwords securely is often neglected in favor of simpler, more habitual practices.

Why PGP Fails to Be an Effective Way to Secure Email

PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) encryption fails to gain widespread use due to its complexity. The process of generating, sharing, and managing encryption keys is difficult for the average user, leading many to avoid it. Most people prefer easier, more straightforward solutions for email security. The technical nature of PGP presents a barrier that prevents it from being a practical tool for securing email communication for everyday users, even though it offers strong protection.

Why It Is So Easy to Spread Malware

Malware spreads easily because it exploits human behavior. People tend to trust familiar sources, often clicking on links or downloading attachments without verifying their authenticity. Attackers also take advantage of peopleâ€™s habits of acting quickly online, where they may not take time to think critically about the safety of their actions. Social engineering techniques, such as sending malware through seemingly trustworthy contacts or platforms, make it even easier to trick individuals into spreading malware unknowingly.
